# Resevation - Henrymends

React, MUI, mockAPI

There are pre-registered 5 Providers and 5 Clients.
A user can choose one of them to login to the application.

### ***
Mockapi only supports the basic features to create/edit/update/delete and search. 
So I have implemented the validations and filters on the frontend side.

## Provider
The provider can submit their availabilities by clicking a time slot or selecting the time period and clicking the submit button.

## Client
The client can book a reservation by clicking a provider name in the available slots.
